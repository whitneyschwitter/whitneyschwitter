								<h2 style="font-weight:550;">Project Overview</h2>
							
								<p>The Herbivore is a compact, passive, two-in-one hydroponic-drying rack system, perfect for the home chef or urban gardener. By combining hydroponic cultivation with herb drying function, this innovative product offers users a convenient and efficient way to grow herbs indoors.</p>
								<p>As part of a university project, I had the opportunity to participate in all aspects of the product development cycle alongside a small team. The overarching goal of this project was to create a tool or product to cultivate a plant of the group’s choosing. Our initial plant choice was basil , but the functionality of our product extends to a multitude of different herbs including chives, cilantro, dill, mint, oregano, parsley, rosemary, thyme, and watercress.</p>
								<p><b style="font-weight:bold;">Project Type: </b>University project, team project</p>
								<p><b style="font-weight:bold;">Skills: </b>Product design, UX design, UX research, Illustrator, computer-aided design, 3D printing</p>

								<h2 style="font-weight:550;">Ideation & Conceptualization</h2>
								<h3>Recognizing the problem & identifying market opportunity</h3>
								<br>
							
								<p>Quickly into the research phase, we discovered that while the average recipe calls for around one quarter ounce of herbs, most packages available for purchase contain around eight times that. This realization led our team to pivot towards developing a product that could help prevent food waste. </p>

								<h2 style="font-weight:bold;">Concept Sketches</h2>
								<br>
								<img src="images/herbivore/concept1.png" style="display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;width:70%;">
								<p>The initial idea we came up with was an expandable and retractable ring that could fit around any planter and double as an herb drying rack. However, we found that herbs thrive in dark environments during the drying process.</p>
								<br>
								<img src="images/herbivore/concept2.png" style="display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;width:70%;">
								<br>
								<p>A major design constraint we had to consider were the materials used to construct the working prototypes. Although our material of choice was recycled wood from the wood shop, time constraints and the decision to create a circular planter influenced us to 3D print the models using PLA.</p>
								<p>The decision to stack the drying rack minimizes the amount of space taken up, making the product perfect for dorm rooms and smaller apartments in line with the lifestyles of our intended audience.</p>
								<p>Combining a passive hydroponic planter with a herb drying function emerged as a unique and desirable concept, meeting the requirements for space efficiency and preservation of herb qualities, perfect for an urban home cook or college student.</p>

								<h2 style="font-weight:550;">Prototyping</h2>
								
								<p>Multiple iterations of prototypes were constructed to refine the design and functionality.</p>
								<p>The hydroponic system was carefully calibrated to maintain ideal nutrient levels, pH balance, and water circulation.</p>
								<p>The drying function was optimized to ensure efficient airflow and temperature control, preserving the herbs' flavor. Our initial design included an enclosed drying rack, but after further interactions we decided to implement a lattice pattern that was congruent with the logo.</p>

								<h2 style="font-weight:550;">Final Prototype</h2>

								<br>
								<img src="images/herbivore/final.png" style="display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;width:80%;">
								<br>
							
								<p>After a few failed prints and countless hours in the engineering lab spent removing PLA from the exterior lattice design, we had a functioning prototype.</p>
								<p>Through a systematic and iterative approach, our team delivered a solution that met the needs of urban gardeners and young home cooks. </p>

								<h3><i>Why Herbivore?</i></h3>
								<br>
								<ul>
									<li><span style="background-color: #FFFF00">Compact dimensions</span> make it suitable for small spaces like window sills in apartments or dorm rooms.</li>
									<br>
									<li>Research shows the Kratky method <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">yields 30 to 50 percent more growth</span> than a traditional soil planter, plus no soil means less mess.</li>
									<br>
									<li>The Herbivore utilizes <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">passive hydroponics</span>
										 so users only have to water their plants once every harvesting cycle.</li>
									<br>
									<li>No need to keep track of when to water, convenient <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">water-level indicator</span> allows the user to keep track of when the plant needs to be watered again.</li>
									<br>
									<li>This <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">2-in-1 system</span> has everything you need, so no need to purchase an additional drying rack.</li>
								</ul>
								<br>

								<br>

								<h2 style="font-weight:550;">Pain Points & Moving Forward</h2>
								<br>
								<ul>
									<li><span style="font-weight:550;">Material & final presentation:</span> design constraints restricted us from constructing a final prototype out of the intended material, recycled wood.</li>
									<br>
									<li><span style="font-weight:550;">Space functionality trade-off:</span> we had to compromise on a size that was big enough to preserve functionality, but not take up too much space. In further iterations, we could consider different scales or even a modular system.</li>
									<br>
									<li><span style="font-weight:550;">Maintenance:</span> to simplify user interaction, we included a floating water-level monitor to keep users from continuously opening the planter, which could affect the growth rate. Still remembering to clean the planter once every harvesting cycle might pose a slight challenge to the user. </li>
