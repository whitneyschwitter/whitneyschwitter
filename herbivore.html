								<h2 style="font-weight:550;">Project Overview</h2>
								<br>
								<p>The Herbivore is a compact, passive, two-in-one hydroponic-drying rack system, perfect for the home chef or urban gardener. By combining hydroponic cultivation with herb drying function, this innovative product offers users a convenient and efficient way to grow herbs indoors.</p>
								<p>As part of a university project, I had the opportunity to participate in all aspects of the product development cycle alongside a small team. The overarching goal of this project was to create a tool or product to cultivate a plant of the group’s choosing. Our initial plant choice was basil , but the functionality of our product extends to </p>

								<h3>Recognizing the problem & identifying market opportunity</h3>
								<br>
								<br> 
								<p>This project began with market research to identify the needs and preferences of potential users.</p>
								<p>We discovered that, while the average recipe calls for a quarter ounce of herbs, most packages available for purchase contain around eight times that. This realization led my team to pivot towards developing a product that could help prevent food waste. </p>

												<li>71% had negative feelings about wasting food</li>

												<li>20% expressed interest in growing their own food</li>

								<h2 style="font-weight:bold;">Concept Sketches</h2>
								<br>
								<p>The initial idea we came up with was an expandable and retractable ring that could fit around any planter and double as an herb drying rack. However, we found that herbs thrive in dark environments during the drying process.</p>
								<p>The decision to stack the drying rack minimizes the amount of space taken up, making the product perfect for dorm rooms and smaller apartments in line with the lifestyles of our intended audience.</p>
								<p>Combining a passive hydroponic planter with a herb drying function emerged as a unique and desirable concept, meeting the requirements for space efficiency and preservation of herb qualities, perfect for an urban home cook or college student.</p>

								<br>

								<h2 style="font-weight:550;">Prototyping</h2>
								<br>
								<p>Multiple iterations of prototypes were constructed to refine the design and functionality.</p>
								<p>The hydroponic system was carefully calibrated to maintain ideal nutrient levels, pH balance, and water circulation.</p>
								<p>The drying function was optimized to ensure efficient airflow and temperature control, preserving the herbs' flavor. Our initial design included an enclosed drying rack, but after further interactions we decided to implement a lattice pattern that was congruent with the logo.</p>

								<br>

								<h2 style="font-weight:550;">Final Product</h2>
								<br>
								<p>After a few failed prints and countless hours in the engineering lab spent removing PLA from the exterior lattice design, we had a functioning prototype.</p>
								<p>Through a systematic and iterative approach, our team delivered a solution that met the needs of urban gardeners and young home cooks. </p>
